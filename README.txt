Note:

The latest GPL version of LSMG on
http://www.sintef.no/Geometry-Toolkits is v1.1. However, the latest
tagged version in the SVN repository is 'stable-1.0'. To the best of my
knowledge, v1.1 is a combination of 'stable-1.0' and the MBA library
(v1.1?). The MBA-files were included for convenience.
